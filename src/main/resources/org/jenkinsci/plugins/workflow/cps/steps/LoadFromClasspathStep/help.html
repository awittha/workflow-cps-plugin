Load text from a classpath resource and evaluate it as a Groovy script.
Normally, pipeline scripts that you would write don't have a way to put resources onto the classpath, so this ability wouldn't be useful.
However, Groovy scripts and pipelines provided through a Jenkins plugin <i>do</i> have a mechanism to put text resources
on the classpath (simply by packaging them up in the plugin) and might want to evaluate some of them from a Groovy pipeline.
