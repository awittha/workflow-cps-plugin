An object to use to get the classloader to use to look for the classpath resource.
<br><br>
Since this will be targeting a Groovy script file (not bytecode) resource on the classpath, 
you must use a <a target="_blank" href="http://docs.groovy-lang.org/2.4.10/html/api/groovy/lang/GroovyClassLoader.html">GroovyClassLoader</a>
to look for the class to ensure that the Groovy script text is located and compiled.
Using a regular Java ClassLoader will only look for bytecode. This may fail - but if it does succeed, the resulting script's source code will 
not be able to be CPS-transformed (since the source code was not loaded) and so it won't be able to be used by pipeline scripts without breaking the whole pipeline execution.
An easy way to find a <code>GroovyClassLoader</code> is to provide the current Groovy script (<code>this</code>) as the hint object.

I haven't figured out how to get the Snippet Generator to accept arbitrary variable names (that of course are not defined right now),
so it will fail to generate a snippet unless you set "null" for the hint.
Proper usage might look like

<code>
<pre>
loadFromClasspath(
	classloaderSource: this,
	path: "com/example/some/classpath/resource/Pipeline.groovy" )
</pre>
